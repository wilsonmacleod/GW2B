# [GW2B](https://gw2b.wilsonmacleod.com/)

A build creator and editor I made for a community of a game I am passionate about.

### This repository manages all bug reports, planned features, requested features and ideas for the site.

### Implementation

This site was created using the **GW2 API** for all information, **React** for the frontend and **Django rest_framework** for the backend. It was deployed using **Nginix**, **Supervisord** and **Gunicorn**.

Check out the site [**here**](https://gw2b.wilsonmacleod.com/).
