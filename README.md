# GW2B (DOWN)
A build creator and editor I made for a community of a game I am passionate about.

### This repository manages all bug reports, planned features, requested features and ideas for the site.

### Implementation

This site was created using the **GW2 API** for all information, **React** for the frontend and **Django rest_framework** for the backend. It was deployed using **Nginix**, **Supervisord** and **Gunicorn**.

Check out the site ~~#[**here**](https://gw2b.wilsonmacleod.com/)~~ 

## The site has been taken down for an update/refactor, my intention is to rewrite most of the site, update the database to reflect recent game patches and make the source code public-facing.

Here is a gif of when it was in  production. ![Alt Text](gw2b.gif)
